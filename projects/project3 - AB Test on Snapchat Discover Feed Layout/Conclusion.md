# Conclusion
Based on our A/B test simulation of 10,000 Snapchat users, we analyzed whether switching the Discover feed layout from a list view to a grid view would lead to increased user engagement, measured via Tap-Through Rate (TTR).

### We found:

Group	Avg TTR
Control (List Layout)	~12%
Test (Grid Layout)	~15%
Using an independent samples t-test, we obtained:

T-statistic: -15.62

P-value: 2.19e-54

Since the p-value is far below 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. This confirms a statistically significant difference between the two layouts.

# Recommendation

We recommend rolling out the grid layout for Snapchat’s Discover feed to more users, as it significantly increases the Tap-Through Rate — a key engagement metric.

This layout change may result in:

- Higher user interaction

- Increased content consumption

- Better monetization opportunities (e.g., via ad impressions)
