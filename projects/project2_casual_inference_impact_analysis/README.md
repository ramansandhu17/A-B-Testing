# A/B Testing with Causal Inference

This project explores how **causal inference techniques** are used to understand the **impact of a new checkout page** on user conversion rates using a real A/B testing dataset.

## Objective

To estimate the **causal effect** (Average Treatment Effect - ATE) of a new checkout page design on conversion rates using techniques from **causal inference** and **A/B testing analysis**.
